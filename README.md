**Caitsidhe-V** (pronounced *Cat-Sith*) is a Cycle-Accurate RISC-V System-on-Chip simulator written in C++.
Caithsidhe-V is designed to **model hardware behavior**, including a bus interconnect and MMIO. It serves as a model for future Verilog implementation and as a sandbox playground for developing hardware accelerators and peripherals.
